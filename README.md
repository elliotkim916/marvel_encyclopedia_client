# **Marvel Encyclopedia**

An application that allows users to search for their favorite Marvel characters.  From there, users learn who they are, what comic books they were in, what events & crossovers they were in, and can save which comic books they've read or want to read in the future.

## **Motivation**

Marvel films and television shows are being released more than ever, with more new fans on the rise.  However, not every fan has read the comics and understands who each character is.  Therefore, I wanted to create an application that makes it easier for users to search for and learn about Marvel characters quickly.
